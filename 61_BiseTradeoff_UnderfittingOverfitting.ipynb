    "The bias-variance trade-off is a fundamental concept in machine learning that helps explain the sources of errors in a model. It is the balance between two types of errors that affect the performance of a model: bias and variance. These two errors have an inverse relationship, meaning that as you reduce one, the other increases. The goal is to find the right balance between the two.\n",
